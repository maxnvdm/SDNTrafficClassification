Explanation of various files (further details can be found in the comments of  the files themselves):
The Selenium traffic generation programs are vulatest.py, outlooktest.py and youtubetest.py. 
These are run on the docker container inside the SDN.

The Dockerfile creates the docker image used to run the various tests inside Containernet (the SDN implementation used).

Classify.sh is a simple bash loop used to run the live classification program repeatedly.

Snortprocess.sh facilitates the live classificaiton process, consisting of:
  1. Start live packet capture on the mirrored interface (snort0)
  2. Pre-process captured packets
  3. Run saved classification model on the processed packets.

Controllerinet.py creates the SDN using Containernet, starting the docker host and switches and then running the various tests on the docker host.

Runnet.sh is a bash script which starts the ryu controller, followed by running controllerinet.py.
This script is for ease of use and essentailly runs commands 1 and 2 in from below.

General process followed for strating traffic generation in containernet
1. Start ryu controller running simpleswitch_snort
2. Start the containernet network
3. Run test on docker host d1

Steps followed, with commands
1. Running ryu and Snort in controllerinet.py:
sudo ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_snort

1.5 Run ryu and snort along with flowmanager (web dashboard to monitor traffic):
sudo ryu-manager ~/flowmanager/flowmanager.py ryu.app.simplswitch_snort

2. Run containernet network (controllerinet.py)
sudo python controllerinet.py

3. Run test on docker host d1
d1 python /mnt/vol1/WebTrafficSDN/vulatest.py

4. Snort a specified number (100) of packets on interface snort0 and store logged file in tests dir:
sudo snort -i snort0 -l /home/osboxes/Documents/tests -n 100

4.5 Use -A unsock to send alerts to ryu controller:
sudo snort -i s1-eth1 -A unsock -l /home/osboxes/Documents/tests/ -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

5. Rename snort log to filename.pcap
sudo mv snort.log.123456 filename.pcap

6.0 Edit netmate flowcalc netAI-rules-stats-ni.xml
- change output file location and name
- change export name from "ac_file" to "netai_arff"

6.1 Install libs for netmate flowcalc (https://github.com/danielarndt/netmate-flowcalc)
- sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
- sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev

6.2 netmate-flowcalc, Edit netAI-rules-stats-ni.xml to output the desired file name and location.
sudo netmate -r netAI-rules-stats-ni.xml -f ~/Documents/tests/outlooktestuct.pcap 

7. Start weka to open flow features and train classifier
java -jar weka.jar

For real-time classification, follow these steps:
1. Run runnet.sh to start Ryu controller (running snort application) and the Containernet program (controllerinet.py)
sudo bash runnet.sh

2. Next run the the real-time classificaiton program in a separate terminal
sudo bash classify.sh
